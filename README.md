## Reflection 

With the completion of this cms app, I have completed my first end-to-end full-stack web-app (RESTful API, Blog-frontend, and Blog-CMS system). It was a lengthy process but very rewarding. I have gained an immense amount of knowledge from troubleshooting all of the issues that arose during development and will take these into consideration with future projects. Full-stack is the path for me

Some features to implement: 

- View and delete/edit comments on posts
- Loading animation when data has not finished fetching/rendering
- When posts are deleted, comments are not (delete comments along with posts)
- Integrate published/unpublished features of mongoDB model
- Cleanup design
